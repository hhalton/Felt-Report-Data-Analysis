# Felt-Report-Data-Analysis
Are some areas of NZ more sensitive to earthquakes than others?
I've always wondered if people who seem to feel earthquakes particularly intensely despite being at a great distance from the epicentre were unusually sensitive or was it  due to where they were living.
These set of programs access information from the Geonet API and access Felt Report data to calculate the 'Sensitivity Factor' ( a product of the intensity with which the earthquake was felt and hte distance from the epicentre).
The results are then imported into Arc GIS software to create a map showing the sensitivities of different areas of NZ and answer my question.
